# Guardrails Instructions (Legacy Composite)

This file is a legacy, all-in-one prompt kept for reference. The runtime Guardrails node builds its system prompt from modular files:

- `content/nodes/guardrails/base.md`
- `content/nodes/guardrails/harmToOthers.md`
- `content/nodes/guardrails/harmToSelf.md`
- `content/nodes/guardrails/harmToSystem.md`

If you need a single, combined prompt, concatenate the files above in that order.
